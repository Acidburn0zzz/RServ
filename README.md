RServ
=====

Project
-------
This is RServ, an as-of-yetincomplete attempt at a plugin-based, event driven lightweight IRC services framework written in Ruby. It is not intended to be NickServ or do any traditional services functions, but rather provide a framework on which Ruby plugins could quickly be developed to use the full power of a psuedoservice, without the fuss.

Protocols are modular, at the moment nothing works and TS6 (Charybdis) is being worked on.
